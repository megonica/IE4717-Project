# IE4717-Project
A web portal for online appointment of family/dental clinic visit

You may choose the family clinic or dentist clinic. Your web site should allow 
patient to browse the background of the doctors and make appointment. Patient 
registration is needed. When booking an appointment with the doctor, the 
doctorâ€™s schedule must be shown and the booking is allowed when the doctor 
is free and available. Once an appointment is made, an email notification will 
be sent to the patient. Both doctor and patient can also reschedule the 
appointment.
